April
April is the fourth month of the year with 30 days. The name April comes from that Latin word "aperire" which means "to open". This probably refers to growing plants in spring. April begins on the same day of week as "July" in all years and also "January" in leap years.
April's flower is the Sweet Pea and its birthstone is the Diamond. The meaning of the Diamond is Innocence.
April in poetry.
Poets use "April" to mean the end of winter. For example: "April showers bring May flowers."

August
August is the eighth month of the year. It has 31 days.
This month was first called "Sextilis" in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus. It was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree).
August is named for Augustus Caesar. The month has 31 days because the Roman senate wanted as many days as Julius Caesar's month July. Augustus is in summer, after July and before September.
An extra month was moved from February in order to make the of August seem more important. This was undone when the leap year adjustment was made.
August's flower is the Gladioli with the birthstone being Peridot.

Art
The word art is used to describe some activities or creations of human beings that have importance to the human mind, regarding an attraction to the human senses. Therefore, art is made when a human expresses himself or herself. Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay bowl that one can put things in. Many people disagree on how to define art. Many people say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity. Art includes drawing, painting, sculpting, photography, performance art, dance, music, poetry, prose and theatre.
Definition of art.
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind or spirit.
An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it.
The first and broadest sense of "art" means "arrangement" or "to arrange." In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.
History of art.
There are sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs dating from the Upper Paleolithic era, about thirty five thousand (35,000) years ago,
All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt, India, China, Greece, Rome or Arabia had works and styles of art. In the Middle Ages, most of the art in Europe showed Biblical stories in paintings, stained glass windows, and mosaic tile floors and walls.
Islamic art includes geometric patterns, Islamic calligraphy, and architecture. In India and Tibet, painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included jade carving, bronzework, pottery, poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.
In Europe, after the Middle Ages, (which some people call the Mediaeval Period or the "Dark Ages") there was a "Renaissance" which means "rebirth". People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented linear perspective where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.
In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism, Romanticism, Realism, and Impressionism. The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, and Minimalism.
Roles of art.
In some societies, people think that art belongs to the person who made it. They think that the artist put his or her "talent" into the art. In this view, the art is the property of the artist.
In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a collective that has made the art, through the artist.

A
A is 1st letter of the alphabet. A is a usual symbol for a low central vowel, as in father; the English long a (ā) is pronounced as a diphthong of ĕ and y. The corresponding letter of the Greek alphabet is named alpha. Alpha and omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet, symbolize the beginning and the end, and in the New Testament, Christ. In musical notation the letter is the symbol of a note in the scale, below B and above G.
words that start with Aa.
2. The highest mark, as in school.
4. An example or kind of, In or to each; per
3. This is a person you can trust.

Air
Air means Earth's atmosphere. It is the clear gas we live in and breathe in. It has no color or smell. It has weight. Air creates atmosphere pressure. There is no air in the vacuum and cosmos.
Air is a mixture of 78.03% Nitrogen, 20.99% Oxygen, 0.94% Argon, 0.03% Carbon Dioxide, 0.01% Hydrogen, 0.00123% Neon, 0.0004% Helium, 0.00005% Krypton, 0.000006% Xenon.
Humans need the oxygen in the air to live. In the human body, the lungs give oxygen to the blood, and give back carbon dioxide to the air. Plants and animals also need air to live: it is very important to everyone.
The wind is moving air. Air can be polluted from gas, smoke, and ash. Some believe that this pollution may be one of the causes of global warming.
Air is also what planes fly through and what politicians are full of.
There are three things in air, Nitrogen (79%), oxygen (20%), and other types of gases (1%).

Autonomous communities of Spain
Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities. "Autonomous" means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the United States of America, for example.
Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In 1978 these parts came together, making the autonomous communities.
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called "historic communities": Galicia, País Vasco and Cataluña. These communities have 2 official languages: Spanish and their own language (gallego or eusquera or catalán).
Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: Ceuta and Melilla. They are called "autonomous cities".

Alan Turing
Alan Mathison Turing (June 23, 1912 - June 7, 1954) was an English mathematician and computer scientist.
He was one of the first people to work with modern digital computers. He was the first person to think of using a computer for different things. He told people that computers could run different programs. Turing introduced the idea of a Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, and ran a set of commands.
Turing also thought of the Turing test.
During the Second World War, Turing was a main participant in the efforts to break German ciphers. On the basis of cryptanalysis he he helped to break both the Enigma machine and the 42 (a teletype cipher attachment codenamed "Tunny" by the British), and was, for a time, head of Hut 8, the section responsible for reading German naval signals.
Alan Turing was a gay man. In 1952, Turing admitted having sex with a man. At that time in England, homosexuality was a crime. He was tried and convicted of this crime in a British court. and was forced to make a choice. He had to choose between going to jail or "chemical castration" (taking female hormones like estrogen to lower his sex drive). He chose the hormones. But this made him impotent (unable to have sex) and made him grow breasts. After suffering these effects for two years, he committed suicide (killed himself) with an apple poisoned with cyanide in 1954.
This kind of treatment is now believed to be very wrong, going against medical ethics and international laws of human rights, and malpractice by most doctors.

Alanis Morissette
Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Grammy Award-winning Canadian-American singer and songwriter. She was born in Ottawa, Canada. She began singing in Canada as a teenager in 1990. In 1995, she became popular all over the world.
As a young child in Canada, Morissette began to act on television, including 5 episodes of the long-running series, "You Can't Do That on Television". Her first album was released only in Canada in 1990.
She also acted in several movies, including Kevin Smith's "Dogma", where she played God.
About her life.
Alanis Morisette's father is French-Canadian. Her mother is from Hungary. She has an older brother, Chad, and a twin brother who is 12 minutes younger than she is. Her parents had worked as teachers at a military base in Lahr, Germany.
Jagged Little Pill.
Morissette has had many albums. Her 1995 album "Jagged Little Pill" became a very popular album. It has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. The album caused Morissette to win four Grammy Awards. The album "Jagged Little Pill" touched many people.

Adobe Illustrator
"Adobe Illustrator" is a computer program for making graphic design and illustrations. It is made by Adobe Systems. Pictures created in "Adobe Illustrator" can be made bigger or smaller, and look exactly the same at any size. It works well with the rest of the products with the Adobe name.
History.
It was first released in 1986 for the Apple Macintosh. The latest version is "Adobe Illustrator CS2", part of Creative Suite 2.

Andouille
Andouille is a sort of pork sausage. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are a lot of sorts, all with different combinations of pork meat, fat, intestines (tubes going to the stomach), and tripe (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from France or Germany (no-one is sure), and the most famous sort in the USA is the "Cajun" style.
Other sorts are "French andouille" and "German andouille"; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra salt, black pepper, and garlic. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

Farming
Farming is the growing of crops or keeping of animals by people for food and raw materials. Farming can be called agriculture.
Overview.
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like flowers, ornamental plants (plants people use to improve the look of their homes) and nursery plants (plants people buy to grow food on their own farms and land), manure or dung, animal hides (skins or furs), leather, industrial chemicals (starch, ethanol, and plastics), fibers (cotton, wool, hemp, and flax), fuels (methane, biodiesel, biomass), and drugs (biopharmaceuticals, marijuana, opium)
Agriculture started at least about 10,000 years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is. Agriculture and domestication started in the Fertile Crescent in East Africa and in the Middle East. The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered (got) many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than gathering on the same amount of land.
Farming actually started with the first nations. They might have originally kept tethered (tied with a rope) animals for extra food. Scientists have many theories about how farming started but most start with first nations, around the end of the ice age (about ten thousand years ago).
Many people live by doing what is called subsistence agriculture, on a small farm. Only the farmer's family lives on the farm. Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and the yield is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated, and they have less money to buy equipment. When yields are low, forests are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the short term, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years.
In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The yield on farms has gotten bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. This results in fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farms are able to produce more food. This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, pesticides (chemicals that kill bugs), and herbicides (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by erosion (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. Irrigation (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. Having fewer farmers also changes society and can make a country less able to feed itself in bad times.
Agriculture techniques.
Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and nutritional value. They also chose plants that are more resistance to disease, more tolerant to drought, and those that are easier to harvest. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation). For example, the yields of wheat in France are over 90 ha. In South America, the yields are 20 qx/ha. In Africa, the yields are less than 10 qx/ha.
Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.
New plants were created with genetic engineering. One example of genetic engineering is modifying a plant to resist an herbicide.
Food.
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and of good quality. Some people say the food is not always good. They say it is sometimes not safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.
Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.
Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. Organic farming is using only natural products. Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.
Problems in agriculture.
There are some serious problems that face people trying to grow food today.
If the plants get a big amount of water they can die, if they get a small amount of water they can dry up and die, so that's why all plants need a perfect amount of water depending on what type of plant it is.
Crops.
The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.

There are specialty producers who raise less common types of livestock or plants.
Aquaculture, the farming of fish, shrimp, and algae, is closely associated with agriculture.
Apiculture, the culture of bees, traditionally for honey, increasingly for crop pollination.
Animal husbandry means breeding and raising animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, eggs, or wool) on a continual basis.

Arithmetic
Arithmetic is what we call working with numbers. Arithmetic studies numbers zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. It is a part of mathematics. The four basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Harder arithmetic includes working with signed numbers, fractions, and decimals, and taking powers and roots.
Most people learn arithmetic in grade school, but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters, plumbers, auto mechanics, accountants, doctors, and nurses. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.
Calculators are used to do arithmetic, but if a person needs a calculator to do simple arithmetic, like 2 + 2 = 4, then they will be too slow trying to do arithmetic on the job, just as a person who needs to look up the spelling of a word like "cat" in the dictionary will be too slow to write on the job. A skilled worker has to have a very good knowledge of arithmetic and the English language in order to earn the right salary.

Addition
Addition is the mathematical way of putting things together.
Arithmetic.
In arithmetic, addition is finding the total of two or more numbers. The sign for addition is "+". The name for the sign "+" is "plus".
Counting examples.
For example, there are objects in two groups. The objects are small circles: "o". One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.
Adding.
In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.
A measurement example.
Tom's house<------------300 meters-------------->Bob's house<-----120 meters----->Sally's house
The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred meters plus 120 meters.
Addition as increase.
Addition can also mean to make bigger.
Less simple.
"Addition" is the arithmetic operation for finding the total, or sum, of two or more numbers. If you are adding three or more terms together, mathematicians call those numbers "summands;" if you are only adding two numbers they are called the "augend" and the "addend." Augend + addend = sum; summand + summand + summand = sum. The addition expression 3 + 8 = 11 is spoken as "three plus eight equals eleven."
Adding two numbers together is a dyadic operation. Addition of summands is calculated by putting dyadic additions together.

Australia
Australia is a continent in the Southern Hemisphere between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. The country called Australia occupies the whole of this continent. Its official name is the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world. Many people also call Australia the "lucky country."
The continent of Australia and the islands of New Zealand are called Australasia. The islands nearby are Oceania.
Geography.
The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many animals and plants live in Australia that are not found anywhere else. These include animals like the kangaroo, the koala, the emu, the kookaburra, and the platypus.
People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the Australian Aborigines. For the history of Australia, see History of Australia.
Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from Britain, became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first prime minister of Australia was Edmund Barton in 1901. Australia is a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations. It is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with the British monarch as Head of State.
Regions and cities.
Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia.The two major mainland territories are the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).
In July 2007 Australia had just over 21 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Hobart and Adelaide. The largest inland city is Canberra, which is also the nation's captital. The largest city is Sydney.
Although Australia is a very big country, a lot of the land is very dry. The middle of the continent is mostly desert. Only the areas around the east and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate (not too hot) for many farms and cities.
Aboriginal people.
The Australian Aboriginal people arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. Until the arrival of English settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They managed the land in a way that meant there was usually plenty of food. An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees. This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people.The aboriginies would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.
Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, because there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria and Tasmania. The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making.
The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.
Terra Australis.
In the 1600s, Dutch merchants traded with the islands of Batavia now (Indonesia), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch Governor, van Diemen, sent Abel Tasman on a voyage of discovery and he found Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen's Land. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.
The British Government were sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that hadn't been explored. They sent Captain James Cook to the Pacific Ocean. His ship, H.M.S. "Endeavour" carried the famous scientists, Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander who were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the Sun. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find "Terra Australis" (the Land of the South).
The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found New Zealand and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon. Captain Cook named that bit of land Point Hicks. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw "New South Wales". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collect hundreds of plants to take back to England.
Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people didn't own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the Government that no-one owned the land. This was to cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.
Settlement.
In the 1700s, in England, there was a very serious problem with the laws. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hanged for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British Colonies in America. But in 1770, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more.
By the 1780s the gaols (jails) of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay, because of the plants found there by the two scientists.
Captain Phillip found that Botany Bay was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbour which he said was "the finest harbour in the world!" There were many small bays on the harbour so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On the 26th January, 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.
For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brickmaker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. The cattle all escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. There was a grave danger that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.
Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and warves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.
While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that of in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.
Exploration.
Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the Blue Mountains. They were not very high and didn't look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and a 17 year-old called William Charles Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the Governor, Lachlan Macquarie founded the town of Bathurst on the other side, 100 miles from Sydney.
Some people, like Captain Charles Sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. Ludwig Leichhardt got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major Thomas Mitchell was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The Henty brothers had come from Tasmania, had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.
Politics.
Australia is made up of six states and two territories. Each of state and territory has its own Parliament and makes its own local laws. The Australian Parliament sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or Federation.
The Federal government is led by the Prime Minister of Australia, who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is Kevin Rudd, elected in November 2007. He is the leader of a political party called the Australian Labor Party. The other main party is the Liberal Party
The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the Governor-General represents the Queen of Great Britain as head of state. The Governor-General, currently, Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce, is chosen by the Prime Minister.
Culture.
Australia was colonised by people from Britain, but today people from all over the world live there. Australia is multicultural, which means that all its people are helped to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning English and joining in with other Australians.
The famous artists, musicians, writers, scientists, soldiers, and sports who are Australian include Patrick White who won a Nobel Prize for his writing, the opera singer Dame Joan Sutherland, the pop singer Kylie Minogue, the cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, the swimmer Ian Thorpe and the athlete Cathy Freeman.
Almost all culture in Australia, films, opera, music, painting, theatre, dance, and crafts — achieve international recognition. From the time of European settlement, a common theme in Australian art has been the Australian landscape. In Australian literature, one can also find very much writings about the Australian landscape. In 1973, Patrick White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Australian to have achieved this; he is recognised as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.
Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.
Sport.
Sport plays an important part in Australian culture, assisted by a climate that favours outdoor activities; 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly participate in organised sporting activities. At an international level, Australia has particularly strong teams in cricket, hockey, netball, rugby league, rugby union, and performs well in cycling, rowing and swimming. Nationally, other popular sports include Australian rules football, horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer Olympic Games of the modern era, and every Commonwealth Games. Australia has hosted the 1956 and 2000 Summer Olympics, and has ranked among the top five medal-takers since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the Australian Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest rating television programs include the summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.

American English
American English or U.S. English is the dialect (or rather, a variety of dialects) of English language spoken in the United States. It is different in some ways from other variations of English, such as British English. Historically, many types of American English can be found in old local dialects of England.
Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another form of English is spoken. This is partly because people hear and read American English via the media, for example CNN television, and the Internet, where the most common form of English is American English.
Because people all over the world hear and read American English as well as other versions of English we may find that the English language starts to take on (acquire) new words. English has been changing for centuries, adding new words to its vocabulary. For example, the English language spoken in India & Pakistan, which has more than one billion people, will add more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from Indian languages such as Hindi & Urdu.
Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America - for example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America. These people often continue to use American English in everyday life.
Many word definitions are different in American English. Most changes in a language start with small things like this - for instance Italian, Spanish, French all came from Latin due to many small changes in use over centuries.

Aquaculture
Aquaculture is the farming of fish, shrimp, and algae. Aquaculture supplies fish (such as catfish, salmon, and trout, shrimp, and algae). Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in China and aquaculture supplies for over 20% of all the seafood harvested. However aquaculture is quite a new activity in Canada as it only began in the 1879.

Abbreviation
An abbreviation is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The English language occasionally uses the apostrophe mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use periods, especially the ones that come from the Latin language. Common Latin abbreviations include i.e. [id est] "that is", e.g. [exempli gratia] "for example", and et al. [et alia] "and others".
Some new abbreviations have been created by scientists, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the Internet.
People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are acronyms.
Here are examples of common acronyms: The word "radar" is an acronym for "Radio Detection and Ranging". The name of the large computer company IBM comes from the words "International Business Machines". The name of the part of the United States government that sends rockets into outer space is NASA, from the words "National Aeronautics and Space Administration". When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write "LOL" to mean "Laughing Out Loud". People sometimes write "ASAP" for "As Soon As Possible".

Angel
In many religions, an angel is a good spirit. In the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Qur'an angels appear frequently as the messengers of God. In all of these, angels appear like humans. They usually have wings like a bird. In Christianity angels are helpers of god who are ministers to the faithful. Angels don't have the ability to sin.
The word angel comes from the Greek word "angelos" which means "messenger".
In the Bible angels often punished peoples for their sins. They tested people's faith in God.
Angels in the Bible are usually pictured with wings and a halo. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness. Few angels are named in the Bible apart from Michael and Gabriel.

Ad hominem
Ad hominem is a Latin term. It is used in rhethorics. Rhetorics is the science of how to speak well, and how to convice other people of your ideas.
Translated to English, "ad hominem" means "against the person" (Latin "homo", where "hominem" is a form is gender-neutral. In ancient Rome it referred to all free men, and by extension to all free human beings).
The term is used to describe a rhetorical argument, that is directed towards the person who says something, not about the cause at hand. It is a way to use reputation and rumour and hearsay to change minds.
When a social network has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a label to them, this works more often.
Because it works and is also unfair to everyone who would benefit from what they say, it is considered to be a weak or poor argument. Formal disapproval of those who use it is common in a court or in diplomacy, where danger is high.
What an ad hominem argument looks like.
In logic, a proof is something that starts with premises, and goes through a few logical arguments, to reach a conclusion.
Ad hominem example.
In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.

Native American
Native Americans (also Aboriginal Peoples, Aboriginal Americans, American Indians, Amerindians, Amerind, Indians, First Nations, First Peoples, Alaskan Natives, Native Canadians, or Indigenous Peoples of America) are those people who were in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean Islands when the Europeans came there. The Europeans were travelling west, so they thought they were going to India. This is why they called the people "Indians".
Sometimes these people are called "Indians", but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from India. The words aboriginal or first people or indigenous people are also used. Other names for these for Native Americans are First Nations (in Canada) and "Red Indians" (this is not used much any more). There are many different tribes of American Indian people, with many different languages.
Many American Indians died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from diseases that came with the Europeans that were new to the Indians, in wars with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as slaves. Most of the American Indians were hurt or killed by settlers who wanted to take their lands.
Most people think that the ancestors of American Indians came to the Americas from Asia. Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when Alaska was connected to Asia by land. Some people think that they came to the Americas even before that. Some of their ancestors may have come along the coastline in small boats or canoes, because sometimes there were glaciers blocking the land between Alaska and Asia.
Some Indian tribes and languages of North America are Cherokee, Maya or Yucatec Maya, Aztecs, Navajo, and Sioux.
Some Indian tribes and languages of South America are Aymara, Guarani, Quechua, and Tupi.

Apple
An apple is a kind of fruit.
The apple fruit is sometimes located on the branch of a tree. A ripe apple might also be green, brown or yellow. The shape of an apple is a ball. An apple is about 18 centimeters around.
The skin of the apple is thin. Apples are hard fruits. Apples can taste sweet. Apples can taste sour. Apples have seeds in the middle.
People first grew apple trees in Central Asia. Apples are now grown in most of the cooler parts of the world.
Sometimes apples are eaten after they are cooked. Often apples are eaten uncooked. Apples can also be made into drinks. Apple juice and apple cider are apple drinks.
The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking. There are some seeds at the core, that can be removed with a tool that removes the core, or by carefully using a knife.
The scientific name of the apple tree genus in the Latin language is "Malus". Most apples that people grow are of the "Malus domestica" species.
Most apples are good to eat raw (not cooked), and are also used in many kinds of baked foods, such as apple pie. Apples are cooked until they are soft to make apple sauce.
Apples are also made into the drinks apple juice and cider. Usually, cider contains a little alcohol, about as much as beer. The regions of Brittany in France and Cornwall in England are known for their apple ciders.
If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have DNA from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also have DNA from the apple flower that pollinated the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grown a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown stump called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed.
In the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple.
Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organisations such as teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit. 'Apple Day' is celebrated each October 21 in many places.
Family.
Apples are in the group Maloideae. It is a subfamily of the family "Rosaceae". They are in the same subfamily as pears. Its family is the family of rose like plants, and roses are in the family.

Abrahamic religion
People use the term Abrahamic Religion for a number of religions that recognise Abraham as an important person. The best known and probably most popular Abrahamic religions are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Another Abrahamic religion is the gnostic movement called Mandaeism. Mandaeism originated in the 2nd or 3rd century in moden-day Iraq and Iran, probably from a movement with Christian backgrounds. Other movements are Bahai and Rastafarianism. The Bahai faith originated in the 19th century and Rastafarianism in the early 20th century.
Even though these religions are quite different from each other in many ways, they also agree in many other very important ways on the basic general nature of the one God whom they worship.
The word "Abrahamic" refers to the ancient prophet Abraham, who is respected in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the first prophet of God.
Another thing Abrahamic religions have in common is that they are "Monotheistic" (from the Greek words for "one" and "God"), meaning belief in just one God.
They also all believe that people should pray to this God often.

Algebra
Algebra is a part of mathematics (maths) that helps show the general links between numbers and math operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing) used on the numbers. Algebra does this by using letters ("a","b","c"...) or other symbols to represent numbers, either because the numbers are unknown or because the numbers change during the course of the problem, in which case the letters are called variables. In many math problems, time is a variable, often represented by the letter "t". Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems. Algebra is taught in school to help in harder mathematics, science, and engineering classes.
Here is a simple example of an algebra problem.
Sue has 12 jellybeans, Ann has 24 jellybeans. They decide to share, so that they have same jellybeans. Let "x" represent the number of jellybeans Ann gives to Sue. Then we want 12 + "x" = 24 - "x".
Here are steps you can use to solve the problem.
1) Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives "x" = 12 - "x".
2) Add "x" to both sides of the equation. This gives 2"x" = 12.
3) Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives "x" = 6. If Ann gives Sue 6 jellybeans, they will have the same number of jellybeans.
Of course, this problem could be solved without algebra. The purpose of simple story problems such as this one is to teach algebra, so that the students can use algebra when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way. Problems such as building a freeway, designing a cell phone, or finding the cure for a disease all require alegbra.
In addition to "elementary algebra", or basic algebra, there are advanced forms of algebra, taught in colleges and universities, such as abstract algebra, linear algebra, and universal algebra.
Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things.
Writing algebra.
In algebra, adding "z" to "y" (or "y" plus "z") is written as y + z.
Subtracting "z" from "y" (or "y" minus "z") is written as y − z.
In algebra, multiplying "y" by "z" (or "y" times "z") can be written in 4 ways: y × z, y*z, y·z, or yz. yz is the most usual form of writing the product of "y" and "z" in algebra.
When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra, we write the number in front of the letter: 5 × y = 5y. When the number is 1, then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number (1 × "y" = "y") and so is not necessary.
When we multiply 2 numbers in algebra, the only way is usually 3·4. × is not used, because it looks too much like the letter x.
In algebra, dividing "y" by "z" (or "y" over "z") is written as y ÷ z or y/z. y/z is more commonly used.
Graphing algebra.
Algebra also introduces graphing and the basic formula formula_1 where "b" is the y-intercept of the graph and "m" is the slope. This formula applies to the coordinates of the graph or formula_2.
History.
The word "algebra" is a Latin form of the Arabic word "Al-Jabr" ("casting") and comes from a mathematics book "Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah", ("Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation") written in the 9th century by a famous Persian mathematician, Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, who was a Muslim born in Kharazm in Iran. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in Baghdad, Iraq through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'.

As
In other words, you can say more generally what an idiom or metaphor says: for example, "battle of the sexes" is both a metaphor and an idiom that suggests "love as war".
Because of this power, you can restate an idiom or metaphor in a way that makes it clear what it means, and what it might assume.

Atom
An atom is the most simple type of particle that makes up matter. Matter is anything that has mass and uses space. It is the smallest part of an element that still has the properties of that certain element. When you see atoms as ball-shaped, they have diameters of about 10-10 meters (that's 0.0000000001 m). They have masses around 10-23g (that's 0.00000000000000000000001 g.)
Origin.
The word "atom" comes from the Greek ἀτόμος, "indivisible", from ἀ-, "not," and τόμος, "a cut." Until the end of the 19th century, many people believed atoms were very tiny, solid balls which could never be divided. This idea comes from Democritus and Leucippus, Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC. People believed this until the early 20th century when tests by physicists trying to provide nuclear power disproved it.
Types of atom.
Atoms are made of 3 kinds of sub-atomic particles - protons, neutrons and electrons. A proton has a positive charge. A neutron has no charge. An electron has a negative charge. Electrons have much less weight than the protons and neutrons. Electrons move very fast around the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of protons is the same as the number of electrons. In other atoms, such as [b]isotopes[/b] the number of neutrons is not the same as the number of protons.
Charged atoms are called ions. Atoms with fewer electrons than protons have a positive charge. These atoms are called cations. Atoms with more electrons than protons have a negative charge. These atoms are called anions.
Structure.
The nucleus is at the center of an atom. The "nucleus" contains "protons" and "neutrons", which are tightly packed together. Because of this, the nucleus is positively charged. Protons and neutrons have similar mass.
A nucleus is much smaller than its atom. The nucleus is more than 100,000 times smaller than the atom - the size of the atom is determined by the size of the outer electron shell. For an example of size difference, if the atom were the size of a football stadium, the atom's nucleus would be the size of a pea in the middle. Most of an atom is empty space which is occupied by electrons spinning around.
Shells.
Electrons orbit at different distances from the nucleus. We say those closest to the nucleus are in one "shell," and those a little farther away are in another "shell." Each shell is given a number. The one closest to the nucleus is shell 1, the next one out is shell 2, and so on.
Classification.
Atoms are usually put into groups based on their atomic number. The atomic number of an atom is the number of protons in the atom. The atomic number decides what family or "element" the atom belongs to. For example, carbon atoms are atoms with 6 protons in their nucleus. All atoms with the same atomic number share many of physical properties and have the same chemical behavior. The different kinds of atoms are listed in the Periodic table. The mass number or "nucleon number" is the total of protons and neutrons.
The number of neutrons does not change the element of the atom - within an element family are several members, each with the same atomic number but different mass numbers. These are called isotopes. To write the name of an isotope, we write the name of an element, then its mass number. For example, Carbon-14 (which has 6 protons and 8 neutrons in each atom). Some isotopes are radioactive, meaning they give off radiation. Others are called stable, meaning they do not give off any radiation. Any atom that has an atomic number of 83 or higher is also radioactive, whatever isotope it is.
Radioactive atoms and isotopes are dangerous to any living thing except in very small amounts. They should only be handled by experts because they can make people very sick if not handled correctly. Doctors sometimes use isotopes. For example, the isotopes of Barium and Iodine are used to help find illnesses, but they should still be handled very carefully, even though they use very small amounts which are not enough to make a person sick.
Only 94 different types of atoms are found in nature, A few more have been made in laboratories). The next element we make could be an ultra-light solid. It could be a liquid with a boiling point of over 2,000,000 degrees Celsius.
The Periodic Table.
Every different kind of atom has a name and every name has an abbreviation. The 94 kinds of atoms are usually listed in a table. The table is called the periodic table. A scientist called Dmitri Mendeleev was the first to think of the table. Because of this and other things he did, element 101 was called Mendelevium when it was discovered. Lots of atoms that have higher numbers are radioactive, like radium and uranium, and should never be handled without a lot of care and protection because they give off so much radiation.
The simplest atom is the hydrogen atom, which has atomic number 1. The most common type of hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 1 electron (with no neutron). The hydrogen isotope containing 1 additional neutron is called "deuterium"; the hydrogen isotope with 2 additional neutrons is called "tritium". It has been the subject of much interest in science, particularly in the early development of quantum theory.
Examples.
The first 11 kinds of atoms (also called elements) are called hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon and sodium. Their abbreviations are H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, Na.
You may notice that Sodium does not fit with Na. This is because sodium was most commonly called "natrium" in the past. This has carried over into other parts of science as well. "Hyponatremia" is an illness where the body lacks enough salt to function properly.
The purpose of an atom.
All matter and all substances are made up of these 95 kinds of atoms. Most things contain far fewer types of atoms. Water, for example, contains only atoms of hydrogen and oxygen. In water these atoms form combinations called molecules.

Astronomy
Astronomy is the study of planets, stars, galaxies, and other objects found in outer space. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. It was done even before history was written. Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, which is not a science.
Early astronomy.
The early astronomers were traders and sailors who needed the stars to guide them at night. Farmers, who needed to find out when planting, flooding, or harvesting times were coming, looked at the rising and setting of certain constellations in the sky. Ancient people who built things like Stonehenge, and the native North American medicine wheels, probably studied the sky for religious or sacred reasons. All these people needed accurate knowledge of the phases of the Moon, the most north and most south seasonal points of the sun, and other information for their purposes.
Some people called astrologers believe they can predict the future by studying where the planets are in the sky when a person is born. Astrology is not regarded as a science these days. In the past, astrology and astronomy were closely linked, and people kept careful records of what they saw. These records have been very important to astronomers during the past two centuries, as they were trying to understand the Universe.
History of astronomy.
Early people studied the stars using only their eyes as telescopes and binoculuars had not yet been invented. People saw some of the planets such as Mars and Venus, and studied Earth's Moon. People made maps of the stars positions and movements and used these for navigation. Early astronomers thought that the Sun and the stars went around or orbited the Earth. This was what everyone believed for hundreds of years. But later, during a time called the Renaissance, a man called Nicolaus Copernicus proved that the Earth moves around the sun. He came up with the idea of a Solar System where the Earth and planets move around the Sun.
His idea was improved on by an important man called Galileo Galilei. Galileo helped to create the telescope which made it possible for people to see things much farther away. Galileo got into trouble with the church though because he argued against the idea that Earth was the center of everything. The Pope passed an order that made Galileo stay in his house and publish no books for most of his life.
After Galileo, people used telescopes more often and began to see further-away objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes and other far away objects such as nebula.
Since the 20th century astronomy has progressed a lot. It is now possible to use very big telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope to look at stars and galaxies billions of miles away. Astronomers now use giant transmitters to look at things using x rays and radio waves.
Astronomy Equipment.
To study astronomy on a basic level you can just use your eyes. Looking at something with just your eyes is called using your naked eye. Many stars are too far away to see with your eyes: you need binoculars or a telescope to see them.
Kinds of astronomy.
Astronomy has become a very large science in the past few hundred years, and there are many different types of astronomy.
Lunar astronomers study the moon, while planetary astronomers study the planets near our sun, and the planets near other stars. Some astronomers study special types of stars, like when two stars are next to each other. Other astronomers study distant galaxies, which are very large groups of many stars.
There are also astronomers who never look at the sky at all. These "theoretical" astronomers use physics and mathematics in combination with computers to create "models" of how the universe behaves, then they compare their models to what is observed. They want to understand and predict the events which happen in the universe, and understand how the universe was formed.

Architecture
Architecture is the design of structures; how they are built. An architect must study for many years to become qualified. The purpose of most architecture is shelter. On a small scale, a garden shed or a stable are examples of simple architecture. On a large scale, architecture may mean the designing of whole towns and cities. In a more general sense, architecture can be the designing of any kind of thing, from a chair to a computer. The word architect is even starting to be used as a verb. A person might 'architect' a system. (This is not correct English, but it is an example of how language changes and develops).
The Word Architecture.
The word architecture seems to suggest something higher, more noble, than simply the designing of a building. A successful building should speak of wisdom handed down through thousands of years. Sadly that wisdom is very often ignored. Most new construction is poor in design and materials. People rip out delicate, elegant wooden windows and replace them with crude, heavy white plastic 'units'. They throw away lightweight slates, split by hand from the mountains, which have turned the softest shades of grey, only because the nails holding them on have rusted. They replace them with heavy concrete tiles dyed red, which make the beams of the roof dip. They build shelves and closets from chipboard (woodpulp and glue, pressed tight to make an imitation of wood). These have no grain like real wood, so they dip and collapse with only a small amount of weight.
History.
In the past, people built huts and wood houses to shelter from the weather. For reasons of cost, the houses were simple and small. For safety, they were often close together. Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures, like the pyramids. The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call Classical Architecture. The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the arch from the Etruscans, who copied it from the Mesopotamians. The stone columns which still hold up so many important buildings, like the Parthenon in Athens, were simply copied from the first wooden posts.
Classical Architecture is very formal, it always obeyed laws. It used symmetry, which really means balance, and it used proportion which means keeping shapes to certain patterns. The Golden Mean was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from centuries of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago.
In some parts of the world, like India, the architecture is famous for stone carving on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.
Later, people in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture, then Gothic architecture. Gothic buildings have tall, pointed windows and arches. Many churches have Gothic architecture. Castles were also built at this time. In Eastern Europe, churches usually had domes. People were copying the Classical Architecture from the past, but adding their own ideas and decoration.
Then in the 18th Century the Industrial Revolution happened and people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many factories and mills were built during, or after this revolution. 100 years later, in the Victorian era, architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style, to build new churches. But towards the end of the 19th Century, architects began to use the newer, cheaper materials like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build. An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them skyscrapers. This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations, but it has also made us free from the ancient laws.
Modernism, which started as early as 1890, has resulted in some handsome, impressive buildings, like the Chrysler Building in New York, but also some truly horrible buildings. The ancient laws have been forgotten, or ignored, as architects have become more interested in doing something 'original'. It seems incredible that we can make these mistakes, when our ancestors built with such skill and beauty. Our wide use of, and dependance on, machines has made many of us think like machines. The famous Modernist architect Le Corbusier once said "A house is a machine for living in". We have come a long way since our first mud huts, but perhaps we have also lost something along the way.

Anatomy
Anatomy is the study of the bodies of living beings (people, animals, plants). It is like taking the body apart, and looking at its parts (organs, muscles and bones). People who study "anatomy" then look where a certain organ (or bone, or muscle) should be, or where it normally is.

Asteroid
An asteroid is like a planet, but smaller. The name "asteroid" means "like a star" in the ancient Greek language. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the Sun, while stars only seem to move because the Earth spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own light. Because of this, some people think "asteroids" is not a good name, and think that the name "planetoid" ("like a planet") would be a better name.
Most asteroids are made of rock, but some are made of ice or metal. Most asteroids in our Solar System are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
Formation.
Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the Solar System. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide to form one.
Discovery.
In the 1600s, Gisuppe Piazzi discovered the first asteroid. It was named Ceres, and is the biggest object in the asteroid belt. Other asteroids, like Juno, Pallas, and Vesta were discovered later. Today, astronomers know of hundreds of thousands of asteroids, which range from fractions of a mile to 600 miles across.

Afghanistan
Afghanistan (Persian: جمهوری اسلامی افغانستان) is a country located in South Asia. It is bordered by Iran in the west, Pakistan in the south and east, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan in the north, and China in the northeast..
Islam is the main religion. Persian (Dari) and Pashto are the main languages. The population of Afghanistan is divided into many ethnic groups of which Tajik, Pashtun, Hezara, Uzbek and Baloch. Although the name Afghan (in its original meaning) refers to Pashtuns only, but under the constitution of Afghanistan, the word Afghan applies to every citizen of Afghanistan. The name Afghanistan means the "Land of Afghans".
History.
The modern Afghanistan was established in 1747 and in 1919 the king of Afghanistan declared independence for the state (from UK control over Afghan foreign affairs) under the new name "Afghanistan". The history of the land does not begin in 1747. Aryan (Indo-European people) tribes settled in the area around 4000 years ago and called their land "Airiana vaejo" means the "Land of Aryans". This name was mentioned in the Avesta, the old book of their religion, Zoroastrianism. The old Greek writers heard the word and called the land of these Aryan settlers "Ariana".
By the middle of the sixth century BC, the Persians who were also Aryans included the area within its boundaries and created Persian Empire. Alexander the great conquered Persian Empire by fighting in 330 BC. After him Kushans, Parthians and Sassanians took over. The Sassanians who were also Persians called their empire "Eranshahr" which later became Iran means the "Land of Aryans". Iran used to be called Persia for a long time by people outside of Iran.
Other people took Iran by fighting like the Arabs (7th century), Turks (10th century) and Mongols (13th century). The area which is now known as Afghanistan was then called "Khorasan" and it was a prosperous and important province of Iran, as it was the seat of most rulers.
The Safavid dynasty (1502-1736) made Shia Islam the religion of their state. Safavids were cruel to Afghans (Pashtuns) who were living in the south eastern parts of Khorasan and their religion was different, it was Sunni Islam. Afghans then revolted and separated Khorasan from Iran in 1747.
The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian empires until it won independence from British control in 1919.
Wars in Afghanistan.
In 1979 Soviet Union attacked and occupied Afghanistan. The occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600,000 to 2 million Afghan civilians and many more refugees. After the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, a series of civil wars continued.
In 1996, Afghanistan was seized by a hardline movement called the Taliban. Taliban were emerged in 1994 and were sponsored by Pakistan. During the Taliban's rule, much of the Afghans experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. The civil wars and Taliban rule left Afghanistan in ruins.
Following the September 11 attacks, the United States overthrew the Taliban government for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden and several al-Qaida members, who were behind these attacks.
In December 2004, Hamid Karzai became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan.

Angola
Angola is a country in Africa. The capital is Luanda. Angola is situated in the south of the continent.

Argentina
Argentina or the República Argentina, is a country in south South America. Argentina is the second-largest country in South America and the eighth-largest country in the world.
About 39 million people live in the Argentina. Spanish is the language most people speak and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. Some of these are Guarani, Mapudungun and Quechua and even Welsh in Patagonia.
The capital city of the Argentina is Buenos Aires, one of the largest cities in the world, in eastern Argentina. In order by number of people, the largest cities in Argentina are Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario, Mendoza, La Plata, Tucumán, Mar del Plata, Salta, Santa Fe, and Bahía Blanca.
Argentina is located between the Andes mountain range in the west and the southern Atlantic Ocean in the east and south. It is bordered by Paraguay and Bolivia in the north, Brazil and Uruguay in the northeast, and Chile in the west and south. It also claims the the Falkland Islands (Spanish: "Islas Malvinas") and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
History.
The name Argentina comes from the Latin "argentum" (silver) as the Spanish conquistadors believed the area had silver. In the Americas, Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).
The oldest signs of people in Argentina are located in the Patagonia (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the Inca Empire conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the Guaraní developed a culture based on yuca and sweet potato however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.
Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.
Politics.
Argentina is a federal republic. The people of Argentina vote for a President to rule them and Senators and Deputies to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is Cristina Fernández de Kirchner since December 2007.
Geography.
Argentina is almost 3,700 km long from north to south, and 1,400 km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the Pampas in the central part of the country, Patagonia in the southern part down to Tierra del Fuego; and the Andes mountain range along the western border with Chile, with the highest point located in the province of Mendoza. Cerro Aconcagua, at 6,960 metres (22,834 ft), is the Americas' highest mountain.
The most important rivers include the River Plate, Paraguay, Bermejo, Colorado, Uruguay and the largest river, the Paraná. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team.
Other information.
The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from Spain, Italy, Germany, Ireland, France, other Europeans countries and Mestizo representing more than 90% of the total population of the country.
Football or soccer is the most popular sport, although the national sport of the country is Pato. Argentina has a number of highly-ranked Polo players. Field hockey (for women) rugby and golf are also favorites.
Argentina is a Christian country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are Roman Catholic. Roman Catholicism is the state religion but Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Many Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well.
Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.

Austria
Austria (German: Österreich), officially "Republic of Austria", is a country in Central Europe. Around Austria there are Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. Currently, the chancellor is Werner Faymann. Austria has been a member-state of the EU since 1995.
The people in Austria speak German, a few also Hungarian, Slovenian and Croatian. The capital of Austria is Vienna (Wien).
Austria is more than thousand years old. Its history can be followed to the ninth century. At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name "Ostarrichi" is first written in an official document from 996. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word "Österreich".
Austria is a democratic state and has nine federal states (): Vorarlberg, the Tyrol, Salzburg, Carinthia, Styria, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Vienna and Burgenland. It is a neutral state, that means it does not take part in wars with other countries. Austria is in the United Nations since 1955 and in the European Union since 1995.
Ancient times.
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age, they time of the Neanderthals. They left works of art, such as the Venus of Willendorf. In the Neolithic age, people were living there to dig for resources, especially copper. Ötzi, a mummy found in a glacier between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the Bronze Age bigger settlements and fortresses were built, especially where there were resources. Salt mining began near Hallstatt. At that time, Celts began to form the first states.
The Romans.
The Romans settled in most of modern Austria. They built larger cities. The most important of these were Carnuntum (near Vienna), Virunum (north of Klagenfurt) and Teurnia (near Spittal an der Drau).
Modern times.
Austria was an empire from about 800 to 1918. And was ruled by The House of Habsburg for most of that period. Then it became a republic. The "First Republic" was from 1918 to 1938, the "Second Republic" has been from 1945. From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Germany.
Geography.
Austria is a largely mountainous country since it is in the Alps. The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country.
Music and Arts.
Many famous composers were Austrians or born in Austria. There are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Franz Schubert, Anton Bruckner, Johann Strauss, Sr., Johann Strauss, Jr. and Gustav Mahler. In modern times there were Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg, who belonged to the Second Viennese School.
Austria has many artists, there are Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele or Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Inge Morath or Otto Wagner and scienc.
Food.
Famous Austrian dishes are Wiener Schnitzel, Schweinsbraten, Kaiserschmarren, Knödel, Sachertorte and Tafelspitz.

Armenia
Armenia is a country in the Caucasus region of Europe. Its capital city is Yerevan. Armenia received its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Armenia touches Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Iran.
There are some minorities living in Armenia, such as Greek, Russian, and other minorities, and more than 90% of the people are ethnic Armenians. Also, the Armenian Apostolic Church, is by far the largest religion in the country. There are a small amount of other Christians, Muslims and atheists.
Armenia is the place that some Christians believe Noah's Ark landed, and Noah's family settled. The Armenian name for Armenia (Hayastan) means Land of Haik. Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of Noah.
Throughout history, Armenia's size has changed many times. Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once. In 80 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, and, of course, Armenia.
From 1920 to 1991, Armenia was a Communist country. (Communism is a political idea.) It was a member of the Soviet Union.
Today, Armenia's borders are locked with Turkey and Azerbaijan, due to conflicts. In 1992, Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting stopped in 1994, and Armenia has had control over this land, but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land.

Archaeology
Archaeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and relics (historical things) left by the people who lived before us. These are called "artifacts", and can include old coins, tools, buildings and garbage (rubbish). Archaeologists try to work out what these remains mean.
To find these remains, archaeologists often have to dig deep in the ground. This is called fieldwork. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist is based, perhaps a University or museum. Every piece of information is written down or put into a computer, so that a picture can be built up. As settlements (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, what went before is often buried. Ancient Rome, for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeology is expensive and why it takes so long.
Sometimes archaeologists find the bones of dead people and the things they used, or the houses they lived in. Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from.
Archaeologists have many different 'fields of interest', which means they do not all study the same things. Some study Ancient Egypt and are called Egyptologists; others study Ancient Greece, or the Vikings. Archaeologists study every civilization that is known, especially the ones where there is no history to read. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the beginning of human life in Africa, or one might study World War II. Some archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea.
Stonehenge, in England is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include Angkor Wat, Machu Picchu, and Great Zimbabwe. In many countries, governments and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.
Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people building are always in a hurry. Quite often as soon as the archaeologists have finished their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are of very great importance.

Application
The word application has several uses.
Medicine.
In medicine, application means putting some drug or ointment usually on the skin where it is absorbed into the human body.
Computers.
When dealing with computers, an application is a type of computer program. At the direction of some user, perhaps set up once and executed many times, this performs a well-defined mathematical or communications function, or retrieves information, or displays or edits a document. How well this works depends not only on the code of the program, but also on the operating system and physical attributes of the computer such as how fast its processor is and how much memory is available.
Physically, the bits making up the application can be on the boot device or a data device, or a device of their own. Usually, some basic applications like a text editor, file browser and telnet do go on the boot device to be sure that they are always available even if only the boot is accessed.
If the bits are on a non-boot device, they may not always be found when required. In the Microsoft Windows operating system, the user may be asked to find the application that is used to run a specific file.
Common types of applications available free of charge include web browsers, email programs, media players, and instant messaging software.
Business.
In business or government, an application is a (usually paper) form filled out and handed in by a person seeking a privilege from a state or company, such as work, credit, some type of license or permit, or a place to live.
Engineering.
At work, generally engineering, when dealing with certain materials or objects, an "application" is a purpose that material or object can be used for. Wood and steel have many applications.

Animalia
Animalia is the name of the animal kingdom. It is a kingdom which contains all animals. Animals are living things which do not make use of light to get energy and building materials (like plants do) to grow. They eat plants or other animals. Most higher animals can also move around, which is another difference with plants. Animals are divided into groups as well.
Grouping animals.
When scientists look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They can then group the animals, according to some of these things.
One classification is that some animals have a backbone, and others do not. The animals with a backbone are called vertebrates, those without one are called invertebrates.
Examples of invertebrates are bees, dragonflies, jellyfish, etc.
The problem with this classification though is that most animals are invertebrates. Therefore, other classifications are used more often, today. The vertebrate phylum is more commonly known as chordata. There are many other phylums, and every other one of them contain invertebrates.

Animal
Animals are living things. Animals are not plants so they can't make their own food or energy by themselves. Animals have to eat other living things (animals, plants, fungi, etc.) to get energy to live. Many animals live in this world. Some are big and some are small. Some live in water, others live on the ground and some animals can fly. Being able to move from one place to another is another distinctive characteristic of an animal.
Some animals eat only plants; they are called herbivores. Other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores. Animals are divided into groups; see animalia. Their mode of nutrition is known as heterotrophic nutrition because they eat other living organisms as food in order to survive.
There are animals living in solitary and groups. Examples of animals living in solitary are tigers, rhinoceros, cheetahs and more. Examples of animals living in groups are coyotes, bees, monkeys and more. Animals living in solitary do not have to share food with each other. Animals living in groups have better protection against becoming the prey of others. Bees and ants are grouped in a special group called a colony. In a colony, the animals work together in a special way and usually have a leader. The leader of the bees is called the Queen Bee.
The animal kingdom is very diverse. There are many types of animals. But, the common animals you know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. There are many other animals, such as insects and sponges! Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups, the invertebrates, and the vertebrates. The vertebrates are animals with a backbone, or spine, and the invertebrates without. Invertebrastes include insects, crustaceans, molluscs, corals, worms, and much more. The vertebrates are divided into 5 groups, fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.

Acceleration
Acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity changes. Acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time. Acceleration is a vector, and therefore includes both a size and a direction.
Finding acceleration.
Sometimes the change in velocity formula_7 is written as Δformula_8. Sometimes the change in time formula_9 is written as Δt.
Units of measurement.
Acceleration has its own units of measurement. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2).
Other words.
Acceleration can be positive or negative. Positive acceleration is called acceleration, or speeding up. Negative acceleration is called deceleration, or slowing down.
Newton's second law of motion.
There are rules for how things move. These rules are called "laws of motion". Isaac Newton is the scientist who made the main laws of motion.
According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, acceleration formula_10 is connected to force formula_11, and mass formula_12.
D'Alembert have also proven that "F-ma=0 That means whatever may be the force acting on a body same amount of deaccelerating force is acting in it.
Acceleration is part of physics. Using calculus, acceleration is the derivative, or rate of change, of velocity. The force something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's mass: the amount of "stuff" the object is made from.
